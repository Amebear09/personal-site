<h2>My top movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Whiplash</h3>
<p>Such an intense story. For someone like me who doesn't have any passion, watching a person burn bright give me some warm.</p>

<h3>Arrival</h3>
<p>Great sci-fi movie. And one, if not the only movie, that makde liguistic professor looks really cool.</p>

<h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>
<p>This is how you made a sequel. The wonderful mixes of present and past. </p>
